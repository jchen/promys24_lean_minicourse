# Proof Assistants 101

Herein lies the source code for the Number Theory Lean demos given as part of the 'Proof Assistants 101' minicourse at PROMYS 2024. 

If you wish to explore this for yourself, you can! The easiest way might be via a *Github Codespace*. You should create a Github account from the top right corner (optionally, you can also [get verified as a student](https://github.com/education/students))

Then, on the upper right of this page, you should be able to select the `<> Code` button and you will have an option to *Create a Codespace* in the *Codespaces* tab. Selecting this will pop up a browser window that will take a few minutes to configure (it has to download Lean), but otherwise your installation should work.

## Getting Started

Refer to our guide for more details on how to get started. Generally, you should be able to select into a `.lean` file (look in the `Promys` folder!) and toggle the infoview by selecting the `âˆ€` symbol. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>-clicking a term will jump to its definition, which is really useful for inspecting library theorems. Refer to the other links in the minicourse notes for more ways to get started!
